Original Design
===============

This assignment is similar to the previous assignment. Start by logging into GitHub and forking and cloning this repository:  

https://github.com/APCSLowell/OriginalDesign  

Now, modify the Java code in the `OriginalDesign.pde` file to create your own design using the Processing graphics functions. Your program should use a variety of the Processing graphics functions. You will also
define four functions:  
`void setup()`  
`void draw()`  
and at least two of your own 

You will also need to modify `index.html` to personalize the title, header and footer. Have fun and be creative! Your design doesn't have to look like anyone else's.

Submit the link to your finished program in the drop box for this assignment by choosing *Submit Locker* and adding the link to your locker.
